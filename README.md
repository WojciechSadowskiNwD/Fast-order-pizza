Here, I am learning new skills while building a mini RWD application. Ultimately, the project will be on Vite, working with React (upgrading my knowledge of React Router v7: a better, more efficient approach to routing, advanced data retrieval and addition to API, forms, error handling, hooks), styling in Tailwind CSS, and most likely much more.

To be completed soon...
